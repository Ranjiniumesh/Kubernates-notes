2. write code to implement blue green deployment strategy using deployment object and roleback in case of failure and explain process
Yes, we can implement a Blue-Green deployment strategy using Kubernetes Deployment objects. Blue-Green deployment involves maintaining two identical environments, one serving as the active environment (Blue) and the other as the idle environment (Green).
Here's how you can achieve this using Kubernetes:
Deploy Two Identical Versions:
Initially, deploy two identical versions of your application, let's call them blue and green. These will represent the Blue and Green environments.
Service Configuration:
Set up a Kubernetes Service to route traffic to one of the environments. Initially, all traffic will be routed to the blue environment.
Testing and Verification:
Test the green environment thoroughly to ensure it's functioning correctly and meets your requirements.
Switching Traffic:
Once the green environment is verified, update the Service configuration to route traffic to the green environment instead of blue. 
This switch can be done instantly in Kubernetes by updating the Service's selector to target the green Deployment.
Rollback (if necessary):
If any issues arise after the switch, you can quickly roll back to the blue environment by reverting the Service configuration to target the blue Deployment.
